For this story (Phising) the victum will be joe and the poser will be Fluffy_bunny_778

So day joe was on tinder because he did not have a girlfriend or wife and he was very lonely. 
after a short time after he made his account he got a message from somebody named Fluffy_bunny_778.
They started chatting and they kept doing this for 2 months, after a while joe wanted to meet this so called
Fluffy_bunny_778 because he wanted to see her in real life. She agreed to this but thier was 1 problem. the
user Fluffy_bunny_778 said she needed money for the plane ticket to where he lived so poor foolish joe did this
and sent her 5 grand. after that the user blocked him and the account was deleted and made of with 5000$ of his
cash. Joe tried to report the user but thier was nothing he could do the account was deleted the money was already
claimed, so to this day joe still is lonely and broke his phone in rage. 

(The account in the story was a simple script bot choosing diffrent line of text dependent on what the other user said)
